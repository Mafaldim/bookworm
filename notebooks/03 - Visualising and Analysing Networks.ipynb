    "There's an anecdote which gets passed around about a young South Korean computer scientist in academia who wanted to rise to the top of his field as quickly as possible. By developing a network of the academics in his field and their people they had published with, he was able to quickly work out which authors were most influential, and the path of introductions and cooautorship that he would need to take from his own, weak position in the network to publishing papers with the most influencial academics and becoming a central node himself. I have no idea whether the anecdote is true or not, but it's a nice story, and illustrative of where and why this stuff might be useful to think about. Applying it to owls and alchemists is fun, but it can be useful in the real world too...\n",

It's a subject worth reading about if you haven't already - it's fascinating, and the world opens up to you in entirely new ways when you develop some intuition around when and where networks appear in nature and how they can be analysed. Clever applications of graph theory are absolutely key to the success of companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.\n",
