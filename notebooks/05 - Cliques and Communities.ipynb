    "Communities are just as important in the social structure of novels as they are in real-world social structures. They're also just as obvious - it's easy to think of a tight cluster of characters in your favourite novel which are isolated from the rest of the story. Visually, they're also quite apparent. Refer back to the Dursley's little clique which we saw back in [notebook 3](./03%20-%20Visualising%20and%20Analysing%20Networks.ipynb).\n",
    "However, NetworkX's clique finding algorithm isn't ideal - it enumerates _all_ cliques, giving us plenty of overlapping cliques which aren't that descriptive of the existing communities. In mathematical terms, we want to maximise the modularity of the whole graph at once.\n",

Modularity is a comparative measure of the density _within_ the communities in question and the density _between_ them. A high modularity indicates a good splitting. Through successive, gradual changes to our labelling of nodes and close monitoring of the value of $Q$, we can optimise our partition(s). $Q$ and its change for each successve optimisation epoch ($\\Delta Q$) are calculated in two stages, as follows.\n",
